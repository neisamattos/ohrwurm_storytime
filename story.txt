One day in the great land of Germany, A man went to his favorite sausage vendor but found a schloss on the door.
Puzzled and disappointed, he noticed a note that read, "Follow the clues to find your beloved sausages!"
On the back of the note he read, "The Bratwurst can be found in the largest city of Germany."
The man then drove to the nearest Biergarten in his Porsche and ate Gebaeck.
